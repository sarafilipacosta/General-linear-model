# General-linear-model
Introduction to the general linear model, starting with a simple regression and last step is where multiple regression becomes the general linear model.

# About this notebook
The first thing here is put up a basic regression. Next, express a design matrix that represents a basic regression. After this is performed analysis of variance and express group membership by including certain specially constructed regressors. 
The final phase is Multiple regression becomes the general linear model.
